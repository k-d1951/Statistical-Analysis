## Descriptive Statistics

- Measures of Centrality 
Mean = Average = Sum/Number of observations  ``.mean()``
Mode = Most common observation/Peak of the distribution
Median = Middle value when all are sorted  ``.median()``

Mean = Median = Mode when distributions are perfectly normal. Will differ if its skewed 

- Measures of Variability (to describe how spread out the data is)
Variance = v**2= ((sigma)((x-x.mean()))**2)/#obs-1
Standard Deviation sd=root(v)
Range = max-min
Modality = number of peaks it contains 
Skewness = measure of symmericness of the distribution so skewed left or skewed right
